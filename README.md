# Excel_Challenge
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organisations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this  Challenge, I'll organise and analyse a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

# Used Method to do the Analysis:

Conditional Formatting   
Column Creation 
percent funded
average donation
category
sub-category
Date Created Conversion
Date Ended Conversion
Pivot Tables Stacked Column Charts and Line Graphs 

# Written Report analysis that:
Draws three conclusions from the data 
States limitations of the dataset and suggestions for additional tables of graph 

# Crowfunding Goal Analysis:
Computed calculations of percentages for projects that were successful, failed, or were cancelled per goal range 
Created a line chart showing the relationship between the goal’s amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation 

# Statistical Analysis 
Computed calculations of the mean, median, min, max, variance, and stdev using Excel formulas 
A brief and compelling justification of whether the mean or median better summarises the data
