# Excel_Challenge
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organisations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organise and analyse a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Used Method to do the Analysis:

Conditional Formatting 
Conditional formatting is applied appropriately to the outcome column 

Conditional formatting is applied appropriately to the percent funded column 

Column Creation 
Six new columns were correctly created for:

percent funded

average donation

category

sub-category

Date Created Conversion

Date Ended Conversion

Pivot Tables and Stacked Column Charts 
Correctly created a pivot table that counts how many campaigns were "successful," "failed," "cancelled," or are currently "live" per category 

Correctly created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country 

Pivot Tables and Line Graphs 
Correctly created a pivot table with a column of outcome, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcome, and filters based on parent category and Years (7.5 points)

Correctly created a pivot chart line graph 

Written Report 
Presents a cohesive written analysis that:

Draws three conclusions from the data 

States limitations of the dataset and suggestions for additional tables of graph 

Crowfunding Goal Analysis (10 points)
Computed calculations of percentages for projects that were successful, failed, or were cancelled per goal range 

Created a line chart showing the relationship between the goal’s amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation 

Statistical Analysis 
Computed calculations of the mean, median, min, max, variance, and stdev using Excel formulas 

A brief and compelling justification of whether the mean or median better summarises the data
